+ **Project summary**: Since China reported its first cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) in December, authorities in 214 countries have reported about 37 million Covid-19 cases and 1.1 million deaths. It can seem like with Covid-19, it is impossible to travel. This app was built for New Yorkers, to show them all the places they are still able to travel to or safely hang-out at, even with the pandemic still present.
