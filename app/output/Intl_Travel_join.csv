All visitors to Zambia must have proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 14 days before their arrival. Visitors are responsible for monitoring their condition for 14 days after arrival, and should report any occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms to medical authorities.    Returning residents may be asked for proof of having tested negatively for COVID-19 in the previous 14 days.    All airports are open to flights, though availability of international flights remains limited. Please check before booking.    International train and bus services are suspended.    Testing on arrival  Anyone entering Zambia with a body temperature equal to, or above 38.0 C will be tested. Any other arrivals may be randomly selected for testing. These tests are in addition to the requirement for visitors to show proof that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the 14 days before their arrival.    Quarantine Requirements  If your body temperature is equal to, or above 38.0, and you have other symptoms of COVID-19 (a cough, shortness of breath, a headache or a sore throat), you will be tested and taken to a government facility for treatment and quarantine until your tests results are known.

With the move to alert level 1, we will gradually and cautiously ease restrictions on international travel.    We will be allowing travel into and out of South Africa for business, leisure and other travel with effect from 1 October 2020.    This is subject to various containment and mitigation measures:    – Travel may be restricted to and from certain countries that have high infection rates. A list of countries will be published based on the latest scientific data.    – Travellers will only be able to use one of the land border posts that have remained operational during the lockdown or one of the three main airports: King Shaka, OR Tambo and Cape Town International Airport.    – On arrival, travellers will need to present a negative COVID-19 test result not older than 72 hours from time of departure.    – Where a traveller has not done a COVID-19 test prior to departure, they will be required to remain in mandatory quarantine at their own cost.    – All travellers will be screened on arrival and those presenting with symptoms will be required to remain in quarantine until a repeat COVID-19 test is conducted.    – All travellers will be asked to install the COVID Alert South Africa mobile app.    Countries that have used this type of app have been able to manage the coronavirus pandemic quite effectively.    In preparation for the re-opening of our borders, South African missions abroad will open for visa applications and all long-term visas will be reinstated.
