","sweden","recommend not leaving house","SWE",20201201,"C4: Restrictions on gatherings",0,NA,"There is a ban on public gatherings of over 8 people. However, the restrictions for gatherings are part of the Public Order Act and explicitly only for *public* gatherings (as cited in the C3 notes), not *private* gatherings under the definition of C4. There is no policy for private gatherings for 2 reasons. First, the rationale of the Swedish government is that it is better to issue recommendations and call on people to follow these and be responsible voluntarily, rather than impose them through legislation. With respect to gatherings, most Swedish regions have recommendations in place which ask everyone to refrain from close contact with people they don't live with and non-essential visits to indoor environments like shops, gyms, and museums, all of which are not covered under the Public Order Act. Prime Minister Stefan Löfven has said that ""it's not possible to legislate common sense"" but has also made clear that the rules for gathering under the Public Order Act should also set a ""norm"" for private gatherings, urging people to cancel dinners, parties and trips to gyms or libraries, but these kinds of gatherings are not covered by legislation. A second reason is that the Swedish constitution in its current form does not allow for limits on the number of people who meet privately.
