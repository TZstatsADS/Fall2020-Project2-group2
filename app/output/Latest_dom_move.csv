However, the Executive Order describes required quarantine upon arrival into Greenland and related restrictions on internal movement ""before it is considered proven that they [entrants to Greenland] are not infected with Covid-19"". This movement restriction is specifically an international travel policy and therefore accounted for under international travel restrictions. C8-2 shows there is a quarantine policy in place.  ""Your trip depends on your final destination   If you have passed a negative COVID-19 test before departure and filled in the SUMUT form, you can travel to the following cities without further restrictions.   The 10 towns and two villages are:   Municipality of Sermersooq   - Nuuk   - Paamiut   Qeqqata Municipality   - Sisimiut   - Maniitsoq   - Kangerlussuaq   Municipality Kujalleq   - Qaqortoq   - Narsaq   - Narsarsuaq   Municipality Qeqertalik   - Aasiaat   - Qasigiannguit   - Qeqertarsuaq   Avannaata Municipality   - Ilulissat   If your final destination is not figuerer above list you   Stay in the city with health center that is closest to your final destination.   If you have a home address in Greenland, you can contact the authorities regarding accommodation facilities for test results.   If you do not have an address in your final destination, you must maintain the expenses that may be associated with overnight stays, rebookings, board and lodging.   Contact your local health center and order a COVID-19 test to be performed at 5 p.m.   In the event of a negative test result, you can travel on to your final destination.   3.
